Hi, my name is Ramesh Chuwan and I was born in Indian. I have been living in Chicago Il for almost 12 years. I choose to learn Software developement because I like to code. Very first time I learn about coding was when I was in college. I took a few coding classes (classes like: HTML, CSS) and i got hooked into it. Another reason for me to choose Software Engineering is job opportunity. I believe, I have a better chance of getting a decent paying job if I am able to learn coding.
